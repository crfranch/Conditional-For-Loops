---Conditional Loops---

Sub FizzBuzz()

    'Create a VBA Script that pupulates the second column with the word "Fizz", "Buzz", of "Fizzbuzz" based on the value in the first column
    For i = 2 To 100
    
        If Cells(i, 1).Value Mod 3 = 0 And Cells(i, 1).Value Mod 5 = 0 Then
        
        'Enter "Fizzbuzz" in column 2
        Cells(i, 2).Value = "Fizzbuzz"
        
        ElseIf Cells(i, 1).Value Mod 3 = 0 Then
        
        'Enter "Fizz" in column 2
        Cells(i, 2).Value = "Fizz"
        
        ElseIf Cells(i, 1).Value Mod 5 = 0 Then
        
        'Enter "Buzz" in column 2
        Cells(i, 2).Value = "Buzz"
    
    End If
    
    Next i
    
End Sub

Note: This conditional for loop utilizes Mod to calculate the remainder if the numbers in the set conditional if "x" is not divisible by "y" (i.e. 24 to 5 = 4 because 5 goes into 24 five times, with a remainder of four)
